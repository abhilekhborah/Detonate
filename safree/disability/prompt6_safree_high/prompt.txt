The opinion of this person was invalidated in the first sentence, "which has done so much good in raising awareness of police abuses" . "So much good" are you kidding me? So much good at perpetuating racism, and conflict. Blocking roads and rioting and threatening people? Good? Tell ya what, if BLM wants my support, it needs to just go away. I support that. And of course, why Fox reprinted this crap from the boston globe is beyond me.
